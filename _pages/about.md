Welcome to our commons! We are interested in teaching archival studies and preservation. Key contributors to this site convene the Archival / Preservation Education SIG of ALISE, a [Special Interest Group](http://www.alise.org/special-interest-groups-sigs-) of the Association for Library and Information Science Education. We launched this website in 2017 to provide resources for educators, instructors, students, and professionals in pursuit of an archival and preservation learning community. Please join us and share your ideas - we're listed under the Contributors tab.
